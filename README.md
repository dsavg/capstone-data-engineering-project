# Capstone project for Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree
Project is work in progress, stay tuned...

## 1. Set up
### 1.1. Amazon Web Servises
* Create an IAM Role on AWS with `AdministratorAccess`, `AmazonRedshiftFullAccess`, and `AmazonS3FullAccess` attached policies [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html). Save `Access key ID` and the `Secret access key` to use in Airflow later.
* Create the S3 bucket named `reddit-project-data` manually

### 1.2. Reddit API
Follow the [How to Use the Reddit API in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-the-reddit-api-in-python-5e05ddfd1e5c) post to set up your credentials for the Reddit API. Ones you've done that, you will need the save the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `password`, `user_agent`, and `username` to use it in Airflow. 

### 1.3. Airflow (v2.3.0)  
Follow the [How to Run Airflow Locally With Docker](https://towardsdatascience.com/run-airflow-docker-1b83a57616fb) to start running your Airflow locally. When the docker container is up and running, you will need to create the following connections and variables in the Airflow environment,

TO DO

### 2.2. Custom Operators
[RedditÎ¤oS3Operator](https://github.com/dsavg/capstone-data-engineering-project/blob/master/plugins/operators/reddit_api.py): Operator to get API Reddit data and store them in S3 in JSON format.

[S3PartitionCheck](https://github.com/dsavg/capstone-data-engineering-project/blob/master/plugins/operators/s3_partition_check.py): Operator to check is date partition exists in S3 path.
